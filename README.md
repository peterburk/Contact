Contact information

The fastest way to contact me is by email.

Please send an email to

peterburk@gmail.com

and I’ll reply as soon as possible!

My phone number and address change whenever I move country. I also prefer to schedule Skype calls, rather than risk being interrupted by a phone call while in a meeting or at church. My email is automatically forwarded to SMS, so I will know about it immediately and I’ll try to reply quickly.

Feel free to contact me via social networks, but I usually only add people as friends on Facebook if I’ve met them in person.

I look forward to reading your feedback!
